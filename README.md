# Ouroboros Coin

Welcome to Ouroboros Coin, a cryptocurrency simulation application developed by Nicolas Anth√®ne and Lucas Leubret and inspired by the Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol used by Cardano. This application was developed for educational purposes and allows you to reproduce actions related to a cryptocurrency and visualize different aspects of it on a blockchain.
Features

    - Creation of user accounts and virtual wallets
    - Currency exchange between users
    - Transaction validation by "validators" selected according to the Ouroboros protocol
    - Visualization of transaction history and account balances on the blockchain

## Requirements

Ouroboros Coin was developed in C using the Qt framework. In order to run the application, you will need to install the following libraries:

    - Qt 5
    - OpenSSL

## How to use Ouroboros Coin

    - Download and install the required libraries
    - Download and install the Ouroboros Coin application on your computer
    - Create an account by providing a username
    - Create a virtual wallet by generating a public/private key pair using RSA encryption
    - Exchange currency with other users or validate transactions as a validator (if you have been selected according to the Ouroboros protocol)
    View the history of your transactions and the balance of your account on the blockchain
